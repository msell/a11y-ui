# A11y UI Library

UI component library designed for Accessibility.

[Example Usage](https://codesandbox.io/s/a11y-ui-tlnml)

This library builds on top of [Reakit](https://reakit.io/).  Reakit was built with accessibility and customization in mind.

** Getting Started with development **

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```

The benefit to using a JavaScript file for the .eslintrc file (instead of a JSON file) as it supports comments that can be used to better describe rules.

The advantage of having prettier setup as an ESLint rule using eslint-plugin-prettier is that code can automatically be fixed using ESLint's --fix option.
